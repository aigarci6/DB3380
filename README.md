Accessing the data Entry form files: In File Explorer, access the "vs" folder and open the "rnrtp2.sln" file using Visual Studio. You will be able to see a large number of .aspx files. These are the files which make up all of our webpages which contain our data entry forms, as well as the SQL commands we used on the buttons to INSERT/MODIFY data into our database.
